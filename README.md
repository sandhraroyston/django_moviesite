# django_moviesite
A beginner-level Django webapp that i created while learning django.
I tried to implement,Django CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) Function Based Views.
It also lets you filter the movie list according to genre.
Django-ModelForm was used to implement the update functionality.
